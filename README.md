# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM: To draw a UML diagram for a library management system

# SRS (Procedure):
Actors Used-:
1) Librarian
2) Student
3) Staff
4) Admin

Software - StarUML

List of Diagrams -:
1) Class Diagram
2) Usecase Diagram
3) Package Diagram
4) Activity Diagram
5) Communication Diagram
6) Sequence Diagram

Procedure-:
1. Define System Requirements: Outline the functional and non-functional requirements, such as user authentication and transaction processing.
2. Identify Key Actors and Use Cases: Determine actors and define their interactions.
3. Design the System Architecture: Break down the system into components
4. Create UML Diagrams: Develop use case, class, sequence, and activity diagrams based on the system design.
5. Test and Validate: Perform testing to ensure the system meets functional requirements and security standards.
